# Short Stories
This repository was originally made for me to store some short stories  I was willing to write and keep and read later when I have some time to make progress on them.
Thing is that the one I am working on right now takes more time than expected and so, I need a better way to share my writings with people better than the geeky solution of git and MD files.
So to keep my document up to date, I have created the docx2md to be able to track the changes and evolutions in the overall story and bring back memories later on.

## Installation

```poetry install```

Convert docx to md
```poetry run python short_stories/docx2md.py ./Homme-Etalon.docx Homme-Etalon.md```
